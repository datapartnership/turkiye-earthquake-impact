# Movement Activity Trends

Understanding where and when population movement occurs can help inform disaster response and public policy, especially during crises.

## Data

The WB Data Lab team obtained a high-frequency longitudinal panel of human mobility. The data consisted of anonymized timestamped geographical points generated by GPS-enabled devices, located in Türkiye and Syria and spanning the period between January 1, 2023 to May 14, 2023.

The mobility data panel has been provided pro-bono by [Veraset](https://veraset.com) to the proposal [Türkiye Rapid Damage Needs Assessment](https://portal.datapartnership.org/readableproposal/427) through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). During the project’s execution, [Veraset Movement](https://www.veraset.com/products/movement/)’s global daily data feed was ingested and processed through the [Mobility](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) pipeline maintained by the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). For additional information, please refer to the [Mobility Documentation](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) accessible to all World Bank staff.

### Data Availability Statement

Data are available upon request through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). Licensing and access information for all other datasets are included in the documentation.

## Methodology

```{caution}
The following working methodologies are a work in progress and waiting peer-review.
```

## Limitations 
```{warning}
- **Sample Bias:** The sampled population is composed of GPS-enabled devices drawn out from a longituginal mobility data panel. It is important to emphasize the sampled population is obtained via convenience sampling and that the mobility data panel represents only a subset of the total population in an area at a time, specifically only users that turned on location tracking on their mobile device. Thus, derived metrics do not represent the total population density. 
- **Incomplete Coverage:** Mobility data is typically collected from sources such as mobile phone networks, GPS devices, or transportation systems. These sources may not be representative of the entire population or all economic activities, leading to sample bias and potentially inaccurate estimations.Not all individuals or businesses have access to devices or services that generate mobility data. This can result in incomplete coverage and potential underrepresentation of certain demographic groups or economic sectors.
- **Lack of Contextual Information:** Mobility data primarily captures movement patterns and geolocation information. It may lack other crucial contextual information, such as transactional data, business types, or specific economic activities, which are essential for accurate estimation of economic activity.
