# Estimating Population Displacement based on Mobility Traces

## Data

The WB Data Lab team obtained a high-frequency longitudinal panel of human mobility. The data consisted of anonymized timestamped geographical points generated by 1,482,694 GPS-enabled devices, located in Turkey and Syria and spanning the period of January 1, 2023, to February 23, 2023 (ongoing). The mobility data panel has been provided pro-bono by [Veraset](https://veraset.com) through the proposal [Türkiye Rapid Damage Needs Assessment](https://portal.datapartnership.org/readableproposal/427) of the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org).

During the project’s execution, [Veraset Movement](https://www.veraset.com/products/movement/)’s global daily data feed was ingested and processed through the [Mobility](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) pipeline maintained by the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). As input, the mobility data has been acessed as an Apache Parquet dataset, partitioned on country, year, and date. For additional information, please refer to the [Mobility Documentation](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) accessible to all World Bank staff.
