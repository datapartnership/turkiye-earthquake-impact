## Data

The WB Data Lab team obtained a high-frequency longitudinal panel of human mobility. The data consisted of anonymized timestamped geographical points generated by GPS-enabled devices, located in Türkiye and Syria and spanning the period between January 1, 2023 to May 14, 2023.

The mobility data panel has been provided pro-bono by [Veraset](https://veraset.com) to the proposal [Türkiye Rapid Damage Needs Assessment](https://portal.datapartnership.org/readableproposal/427) through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). During the project’s execution, [Veraset Movement](https://www.veraset.com/products/movement/)’s global daily data feed was ingested and processed through the [Mobility](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) pipeline maintained by the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). For additional information, please refer to the [Mobility Documentation](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) accessible to all World Bank staff.
