## Data

The WB Data Lab team obtained a high-frequency longitudinal panel of human mobility. The data consisted of anonymized timestamped geographical points generated by GPS-enabled devices, located in Türkiye and Syria and spanning the period between January 1, 2023 to the latest release date of this study.

The mobility data panel has been provided pro-bono by [Veraset](https://veraset.com) to the proposal [Türkiye Rapid Damage Needs Assessment](https://portal.datapartnership.org/readableproposal/427) through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). During the project’s execution, [Veraset Movement](https://www.veraset.com/products/movement/)’s global daily data feed was ingested and processed through the [Mobility](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) pipeline maintained by the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). For additional information, please refer to the [Mobility Documentation](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) accessible to all World Bank staff.
