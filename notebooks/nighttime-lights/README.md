# Nighttime Lights

Nighttime lights have become a commonly used resource to estimate changes in local economic activity. This section shows changes in nighttime lights in Turkiye from before and after the earthquake.

## Data

We use nighttime lights data from the VIIRS Black Marble dataset. Raw nighttime lights data requires correction due to cloud cover and stray light, such as lunar light. The Black Marble dataset applies advanced algorithms to correct raw nighttime light values and calibrate data so that trends in lights over time can be meaningfully analyzed. We use daily and monthly data from VIIRS Black Marble.

## Methodology

We extract average nighttime lights within each administrative unit in Turkiye. We distinguish lights between lights observed in gas flaring locations and lights in other locations. Oil extraction and production involves gas flaring, which produces significant volumes of light. Separately examining lights in gas flaring and other locations allows distinguishing between lights generated due to oil production versus other sources of human activity. We use data on the locations of gas flaring sites from the [Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction); we remove lights within 5km of gas flaring sites.

## Implementation

Code to replicate the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/ntl/notebooks/nighttime-lights).

The code largely relies on an R package (`blackmarbler`) that is currently being created to faciliate downloading and processing Black Marble nighttime lights data. The package [documentation](https://ramarty.github.io/blackmarbler/) provides some generic examples for how to download data, make a map of nighttime lights, and show trends in nighttime lights. The below code leverages the package to produce analytics for Turkiye.

The main script ([_main.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/_main.R)) loads all packages and runs all scripts for the analysis. Below we document scripts for (1) creating analysis-ready datasets and (2) producing analytics (eg, figures) of nighttime lights data.

### Create Analysis-Ready Nighttime Lights Datasets

The below code downloads and processes nighttime lights data.

* [01_clean_gas_flaring_data.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/01_clean_gas_flaring_data.R): Produces a clean dataset of the locations of gas flaring locations. This dataset is needed because we summarize nighttime lights for (1) all lights, (2) lights excluding gas flaring loations, and (3) lights only in gas flaring locations.
* [02_download_black_marble.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/02_download_black_marble.R): Downloads Black Marble nighttime lights data for annual, monthly, and daily nighttime lights data. The script exports a geotiff file of nighttime lights for each time period (eg, for each year for annual data). If the script is run at a later date, only data that has not already been downloaded will be downloaded.
* [03_aggregate.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/03_aggregate): Aggregates nighttime lights to administrative levels 0, 1 and 2. Calculates average nighttime lights within each administrative unit. The script produces a separate file for each time period. For example, for daily data, a single dataset is saved for aggregated nighttime lights for January 1, 2023, at the ADM2 level. The next script appends files across time periods (eg, days) into a single dataset. Separate files are saved in order to facilitate aggregating new data, as aggregating data can take some time. The script skips aggregating data that has already been processed.
* [04_append.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/04_append.R): Appends aggregated data for each time period. Creates a separate datasets for annual, monthly, and daily nighttime lights data.

### Nighttime Lights Analytics

The below code analyzes the nighttime lights data, producing figures and tables.

* [05_map_ntl_annual.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_map_ntl_annual.R): Produce annual maps of nighttime lights
* [05_maps_ntl_changes.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_maps_ntl_changes.R): Produce maps of changes in nighttime lights from before and after the earthquake.
* [05_ntl_trends_daily.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_ntl_trends_daily.R): Produce daily trends in daily nighttime lights for each administrative unit. Administrative units are group by earthquake intensity.
* [05_ntl_trends_monthly.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_ntl_trends_monthly.R): Produce daily trends in daily nighttime lights for each administrative unit. Administrative units are group by earthquake intensity.
* [05_avg_ntl_by_period.R](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_avg_ntl_by_period.R): Create a dataset of average nighttime lights for each administrative unit for different time periods.

## Data

The data for the analysis can be accessed from:

* [Gas Flaring Location Data](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037743)

* __Black Marble Nighttime Lights:__ There are two options to access the data:

  * The code [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/02_download_black_marble.R) downloads raw data from the [NASA archive](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/VNP46A3/) and processes the data for Turkiye---mosaicing raster tiles together to cover Turkiye. Running the code requires a NASA bearer token; the documentation [here](https://github.com/ramarty/blackmarbler) describes how to obtain a token.

  * Pre-processed data can be downloaded from [here](URL), using the __Night Time Lights BlackMarble Data__

## Findings

### Map of Nighttime Lights

The below figure shows nighttime lights from the latest year available. As expected, Turkiye’s largest cities are the most brightly lit – such as Instanbul in the north west.

[This script](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_map_ntl_annual.R) produces the below figure, where the relevant code is also documented below. Before running the below code, the code from [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/blob/ntl/notebooks/nighttime-lights/_main.R) needs to be run to load packages and define file paths.

```{r}
#### Load Turkiye polygon
adm2_sf <- read_sf(dsn = file.path(adm_dir, "tur_polbna_adm2.shp"))

#### Load and prep NTL raster
## Load raster
r <- raster(file.path(ntl_bm_dir, "FinalData", "VNP46A4_rasters", "VNP46A4_t2021.tif")

## Crop/mask to Turkiye polygon
r <- r %>% crop(adm2_sf) %>% mask(adm2_sf)

## Convert to dataframe for plotting with ggplot
r_df <- rasterToPoints(r, spatial = TRUE) %>% as.data.frame()
names(r_df) <- c("value", "x", "y")

## Remove very low values of NTL; can be considered noise
r_df$value[r_df$value <= 2] <- 0

## Distribution is skewed, so log
r_df$value_adj <- log(r_df$value+1)

#### Make map
ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = r_df,
                aes(x = x, y = y,
                    fill = value_adj)) +
    scale_fill_gradient2(low = "black",
                         mid = "yellow",
                         high = "red",
                         midpoint = 4.5) +
    labs(title = paste0("Nighttime Lights ", year_i)) +
    coord_quickmap() +
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
          legend.position = "none")
```

### Changes in Nighttime Lights

The below figures show the change in nighttime lights from the two weeks before the earthquake (February 6, 2023) to two weeks after the earthquake. The figures show that many locations saw an increase in nighttime lights immediately after the earthquake. Increases in nighttime lights could result from lights generated from rescue efforts.

[This script](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/tree/main/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_maps_ntl_changes.R) produces the below two figures, where the relevant code is also documented below. The code relies on daily nighttime lights data that has been aggregated to the ADM2 level. Before running the below code, the code from [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/blob/ntl/notebooks/nighttime-lights/_main.R) needs to be run to load packages and define file paths.

```{r}

    date %in% ymd("2023-02-07"):ymd("2023-02-20") ~ "ntl_after"
  )) %>%

  ## Average NTL by ADM2 and time period (two weeks before / after)
  group_by(period, pcode) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(ntl_bm_mean = mean(ntl_bm_mean)) %>%

  ## Reshape from long to wide
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = pcode, names_from = period, values_from = ntl_bm_mean) %>%

  ## Determine % change and classify as large increase/decrease
  mutate(ntl_pchange = (ntl_after - ntl_before) / ntl_before * 100) %>%

  dplyr::mutate(change_type = case_when(
    ntl_pchange >= 10 ~ "> 10% Increase",
    ntl_pchange <= -10 ~ "> 10% Decrease",
    TRUE ~ "Small change"
  )) %>%

  ## Merge in earthquake data and determine max intensity
  left_join(eq_df, by = "pcode") %>%
  mutate(mi_max = pmax(mmi_feb06_6p3, mmi_feb06_6p7,
                       mmi_feb06_7p5, mmi_feb20_6p3,
                       mmi_feb06_7p8, mmi_feb06_6p0))

## Merge in percent change data to ADM2 spatial file
adm2_sf <- adm2_sf %>%
  left_join(ntl_sum_df, by = "pcode")

## Deal with outliers
adm2_sf$ntl_pchange[adm2_sf$ntl_pchange > 50] <- 50

### Trends in Nighttime Lights

The below figure shows daily trends in nighttime lights for administrative units where there was the largest earthquake intensity (a magnitude of 9 or higher). In most locations, nighttime lights remains relatively unchanged. However, Antakya---which had the largest nighttime lights---saw a sharp reduction in nighttime lights.

[This script](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/blob/ntl/notebooks/nighttime-lights/05_ntl_trends_daily.R) produces the below figure, where the relevant code is also documented below. The code relies on daily nighttime lights data that has been aggregated to the ADM2 level; this dataset is produced using. Before running the below code, the code from [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/turkiye-earthquake-impact/blob/ntl/notebooks/nighttime-lights/_main.R) needs to be run to load packages and define file paths.

## Limitations

Nighttime lights are a common data source for measuring local economic activity. However, it is a proxy that is strongly—although imperfectly—correlated with measures of interest, such as population, local GDP, and wealth. Consequently, care must be taken in interpreting reasons for changes in lights.

Caution should also be taken when making conclusions of earthquake impacts based on nighttime lights. Changes in nighttime lights could be driven by multiple factors---such as rescue efforts generating lights, to damages and people leaving high-hit areas causing a reduction in nighttime lights.

## Next Steps

Next steps can focus on continuing to monitor trends in nighttime lights over time. In particular, it will be useful to examine changes in nighttime lights in the weeks and months after the earthquake---when rescue efforts and the lights they generated are done. Consequently, any persistent changes in nighttime lights observed in the weeks and months after the earthquake would be indicative of damages or people moving away. Analysis of data from other sources could shed insight to whether any reductions in nighttime lights are due to damanges or people moving awawy.
