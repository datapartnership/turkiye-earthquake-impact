## Data Products Summary

**Data Products** are produced using the **Foundational Datasets** and can be further used to generate indicators and insights. All Data Products include documentation, references to original data sources (and/or information on how to access them), and a description of their limitations.

Following is a summary of Data Products used in this Data Good:
