## Sample Indicators

**Indicators** can be derived from a combination of **Foundational Datasets** and **Data Products**. By combining Foundational Datasets and Data Products, teams can, on-demand, develop a large array of indicators to meet their project needs. Indicators can presented side-by-side in an Excel workbook -- a format that is generally accessible to the widest audiences. Because all indicators are based on the same underlying data, they are comparable with each other, across geographies and across time.

For this project, sample indicators have been derived and aggregated at the Admin 2 level over multiple time periods, to show changing trends in each area over time. Here is a link to the [**Indicators Excel workbook**](https://worldbankgroup.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/DevelopmentDataPartnershipCommunity-WBGroup/EUeOvCYy-J5Any7OhhspubQBbykjOv0ew9MAZg4oGz2i3w?e=De1jpa) (accessible to team members via SharePoint), and following is a summary of the sample indicators by Administrative Level 2, over a baseline and weekly post-earthquake periods: 

* Population

* Intensity of the 2/6 and 2/20/2023 quakes

* Meta Business Activity Trends (% change)

* Ookla Speed Test Activity and Meta Network Availability (% change)

* Veraset Mobile Device Activity Levels (% change)

* Nighttime Lights (% change)

* Government-Reported Number of Collapsed and Heavily Damaged Buildings


### Sample indicator: Observing change in Business Activity for a specific business vertical

By overlaying multiple datasets together, it is possible to study changes in business activity further. For instance, in the below map, we can see the changes in Business Activity for the retail sector overlayed with damaged buildings information from the MoECC. Some admin 2 regions' retail activity remained relatively unaffected immediately after the earthquake despite damage to buildings.
